        <h2>What is ORV ?</h2>
        <p>Omniscient Reader Viewpoint also known as ORV is a very popular south korean webtoon and light novel series written by the married couple Sing-Shong. It is about a dorky guy named kim dokja who is the only reader of a really really long webnovel.  The day the epilouge for the webnovel comes out the  apocalypse starts in the form of that web novel  and Kim Dokja is the only one who knows what to do because he read the novel like a bible.</p>

        <p> Orv is so popular that it is getting a live action adaptation that comes out this july and its getting an anime. It is very similar to solo leveling but with more fleshed out and complex charecters. This webtoon is like a lovestory to stories and storytelling and it has really cool action and emotion.</p>
