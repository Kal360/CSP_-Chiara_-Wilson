            <p>Terry Pratchett was a very cool guy and I'm glad he wrote so many books. His series of books is unique because each of his books is self contained and can be read as standalones. You can read the series in any order and still understand what is going on. Though there are some references to to other books in his series in his books.  If you want the full experiance I reccomend you read the whole series.</p>
